<h2>Welcome to [REDACTED]</h2>
<p>
There is a theory which suggests that there is an infinite number of universes, therefore there exists an infinite number of Gregory's.
What this Gregory lacked in athletic prowess, he made up with a brilliant mind and ingenuity.
For the Fattywood Junior High Science Fair, Gregory built a teleportation device. 
However, due to unexpected interference during a demonstration, the device malfunctioned and teleported everyone to an unknown pocket dimension; where the ravages of time does not affect the human body.
In the process of teleportation, only Gregory and his skinny classmates miraculously survived.
With his despair, autism, and hunger reaching a boiling point, Gregory snaps and begins a cannibalistic murderous spree.
Will the skinny kids be devoured by Gregory, or will they survive and spend an eternity in this purgatory until their spirits break?
